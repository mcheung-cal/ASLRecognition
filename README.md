# 🤟 ASL Alphabet Classifier

## 📝 Description  
A machine learning model that classifies American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet letters from images of hand gestures.

## 💡 Features  
- ✅ Recognizes 24 static ASL letters (excluding J & Z due to motion requirements)  
- ✅ Uses deep learning models for classification  
- ✅ Data augmentation to improve model generalization  
- ✅ Evaluates model performance with accuracy and confusion matrices  

## 🛠️ Built with  
- Python  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- OpenCV  

## 📊 Models Used  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN)  
- Residual Neural Network (ResNet)  
- SqueezeNet  
- LeNet-5  
- EfficientNet  
- Random Forest
